Independent Study Research on the development of a RAG model over MSU texas information

## Extracting the information with 'Unstructured' library
Extracting and chunking information is probably the most important step toward building a RAG model that works well.
Searching the web, I recently found this python library that allows you to extract data from different type of files and 
during the extarction process it also saves really important feature of the metadata, wich make the Retriever more efficient 
as it has more context to look into.
